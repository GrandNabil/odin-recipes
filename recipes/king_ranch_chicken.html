        <li>10 (6 inch) corn tortillas, cut into quarters</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1</li>
            <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>
        <li>Step 2</li>
            <p> Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat. Saute onion and bell peppers in the hot oil until warmed through, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl.</p>
        <li>Step 3</li>
            <p>
                Add both cans of condensed soup, diced tomatoes with chile peppers, chicken broth, sour cream, cumin, ancho chile powder, oregano, and chipotle chile powder; mix until sauce is well-combined.
            </p>
        <li>Step 4</li>
            <p>
                Spread a few tablespoons of sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Layer with 1/2 of the chicken, 1/2 of the sauce, 1/2 of the Cheddar cheese, and 1/2 of the tortillas.
            </p>
        <li>Step 5</li>
            <p>
                Spread the remaining chicken over the tortillas. Spread all but 1/2 cup of the remaining sauce over the chicken, then top with another 1/3 of the Cheddar, and the remaining tortillas. Spread the remaining 1/2 cup over top, and sprinkle with the remaining Cheddar.  
            </p>
        <li>Step 6</li>
            <p>
                Bake casserole in the preheated oven until bubbling, about 40 minutes.
            </p>
        <li>Step 7</li>
            <p>
                Turn on the broiler and broil until the top is golden, 2 to 3 more minutes
            </p>
